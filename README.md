# SeaBattle or BattleShip Game created in team with Phaser
##### :clock1130: Date:

##### :muscle: What was my motivation?
Using Phaser was a requirement for a module at Hyper Island but me and my team decided on the game before we knew how to use Phaser. Apparently, our Phaser Game was a little bit different from other students' games, since no one is running, jumping or killing anyone there.
##### :books: What did I learn?
What is Phaser, how to go around rules (like creating a grid in this framework or getting by without creating a scene), how to destructure code, manage organization in team (since I took the responsibility for that) and that Math is actually used by Frontend Developers xd. I Pseudocoded the steps by getting inpired by a description on how to create this game in Vanilla JS, but ended up creating a new and modified Pseudocode since working with Phaser was a little bit different.
##### :flashlight: How to use the project?
We could deliver a You-Against-PC version of this game, so you will have 70 attempts to find 6 piece of 2-cell-ship and 4 piece of 1-cell-ship. PLEASE, MUTE YOUR PC BEFORE TRYING IT OUT IF YOU ARE SOUND SENSITIVE.
